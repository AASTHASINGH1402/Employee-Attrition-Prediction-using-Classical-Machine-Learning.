Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict
 whether an employee is likely to leave the company using the
 IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset.
 • Performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to
 understand feature distributions, uncover correlations, and
 identify class imbalance and outliers.
 • Applied data preprocessing techniques including label
 encoding, one-hot encoding, feature scaling (StandardScaler),
 and train-test splitting.
 • Trained and evaluated multiple classification models: Logistic
 Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and Support
 Vector Machine (SVM).
 • Evaluated models using key performance metrics: accuracy,
 precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC
 curve.
 • Achieved over 85% accuracy and high recall for minority class,
 demonstrating practical application of ML for HR analytics and
 employee retention strategies.
